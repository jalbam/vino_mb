Description

This software belongs to the final exercice for the course at Instituto Microbits academy in Reus city (Spain) in 2006. Made together with Yasmina Llaveria del Castillo.

It is a highly configurable cross-platform and cross-browser online shop to sell wine but can be easily adapted to sell any other product. Uses a mySQL database.

Automatically detects JavaScript support. JavaScript is not needed but it is used in the case it is available (for example, to detect screen resolution so that the PHP engine can know it).
